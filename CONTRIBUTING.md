# Contribution Guidelines

If you want to help shape the Cypher system by contributing code, that’s very cool! Here’s how we can do that:

1. Please talk to me before working hard on your feature. Most likely there are some design decisions to be made and I think it’s a good idea to talk that through beforehand. You can either [create an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-foundryvtt/issues/new/choose) or we talk on the [Cypher FVTT Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/C5zGgtyhwa), where it’s more likely that other users chime in as well.

2. I’m following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). That means I’m actively working on the develop branch while the main branch does reflect the current release, with more substantial and experimental features (i.e., features I’m not sure I will actually implement) getting their own feature branch. So all your work should be based on the develop branch.

3. If you work on multiple features at the same time, it might be a good idea to create separate branches for each feature, so it’s easier to commit some of your features while still working on others.

4. I’m not vain when it comes to the coding style (although I’d appreciate it if you tried to keep it consistent with my style), but I’m also a relative beginner, so I want to make sure I understand your code. I’m still having some difficulties reading nested code and shortcuts (like arrow functions, though it’s getting better), so please try to avoid that where it can sensibly avoided.

5. Create a pull request for each feature to the develop branch. Pull requests that target the main branch will be closed with the request for a new pull request targeting the develop branch.
